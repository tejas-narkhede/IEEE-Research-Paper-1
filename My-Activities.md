Just a quick intro...    
Hi, I am Tejas an AI-ML enthusiast, working in dense matter of Mathematics and Logics.       
and Here I will be posting my learning and project activities thoughout the year, if I forgot will post next time +_+    
to give short info of what I did upto now is,    
started with C/C++ Prog and Python    
Explored Astrophysics and Astronomy   
Learned more about Radio Astronomy   
Started learning Quantum Computing and QML   
Started Learning Machine Learning and AI   
Learned basics of Deep Learning   
Did a course on Mathematics for Machine learning    
Started with Computational Statistics as honors sub. for sem-6   
Was feeling horrible, stressed and depressed, and took a break from learning for 3-4 months reading good books and novels    
And I am back to learning and implementing new ideas and projects.   
Now Learning from Scratch (not too long)
